# Week 1: Introduction to ML

## Study Guide

### Core Concepts
1. How does machine learning's goal differ from that of economics, psychology, or statistics?
2. What are two important problems that machine learning addresses?
3. Why can't we generalize without making assumptions?

### Problem Types
4. What determines whether a problem is classification or regression?
5. How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning in terms of feedback?
6. What role do labels play in choosing your learning approach?

### Mathematical Framework
7. When would you prefer squared loss over 0-1 loss?
8. What's problematic about only minimizing training error?
9. How do model assumptions constrain your hypothesis space?

### Geometric Understanding
10. What geometric object does a linear classifier define?
11. How do $\theta$ and $\theta_0$ relate to the decision boundary?
12. Why might feature engineering be more important than the classifier choice?

### Learning and Evaluation
13. What's the difference between evaluating a hypothesis and evaluating an algorithm?
14. When might a simpler hypothesis class outperform a complex one?
15. Under what conditions could random search be effective?

### Practical Considerations
16. Why is finding the optimal linear classifier computationally difficult?
17. What trade-off exists between training performance and generalization?
18. What do you assume about future data when training a classifier?
