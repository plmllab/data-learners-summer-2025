# Data Learners: Machine Learning Bootcamp (Summer 2025)


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this bootcamp, you will be able to:
1. **Understand core machine learning concepts and algorithms**
	- Grasp key ideas such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, overfitting, generalization, etc. 
	- Understand the mathematical foundations behind commonly used algorithms (e.g., linear regression, neural networks)
2. **Develop proficiency in Python for data science and machine learning**
	- Master **NumPy** for numerical computing and vectorized operations
	- Master **PyTorch** for building and training deep learning models
3. **Implement machine learning algorithms from scratch and using frameworks**
	- Build ML models using NumPy and PyTorch.
	- Apply ML techniques to read datasets in structured projects. 

## Learning Methods
To support your learning, the following methods will be used:

### Study Guide Questions 
> A list of essential questions will guide your weekly learning. These are designed to help you identify key concepts and reflect on your understanding. You should be able to confidently answer them by the end of each week.
> 
### Readings and Videos
>Curated resources--including lecture videos, tutorials, and textbook excerpts--will help you build conceptual foundations. These materials are selected to balance theory and practical understanding.

### Coding Exercises
>Weekly programming tasks will reinforce your Python, NumPy, and PyTorch skills, particularly in the context of machine learning and data science.

### Projects 
>You will complete **hands-on projects** to practice real-world machine learning workflows. These will involve
>- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
>- Model implementation and training
>- Evaluation and reflection
